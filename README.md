# Python Assignment

## Setting up your development environment:
My work for this section is in `kanyePackage.py`
1. Set up a development enviornment in Python and import a few standard Python Packages.

## List comprehension exercises:
My work for this section is in `listComprehension.py` 
1. Write a Python program to check if the elements in list are unique or not. List: [1, 2, 3, 1 , 5, 80, 80, 90, 4, 5, 8, 9, 10]
2. Write a Python program to calculate the average of two lists: List A: [1, 10, 7, 3, 8], List B: [0, 9, 80, 4, 1]
3. Square the even numbers in mylist and store the result in a evenlist:  mylist = [2, 10, 5, 8, 7]

## Assertion Exercise:
My work for this section is in `coordinates.py` and `coordinateTesting.py`
1. Assume a cartesian cordinate space R = R(x,y,z).
2. Each of the co-ordinates, (x,y,z) can have only integer values >= 0 The maximum value each of the co-odinates can assume,
and the sum of all three co-ordinates (the tuple) is capped at integer N.
3. Using assertion, verify that a given set of coordintes match the expectation for a set value of N = 7.
